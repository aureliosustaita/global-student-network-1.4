This update improves the UI for the laptop version by optimizing Flexbox usage, reducing redundant CSS, and enhancing maintainability. Colors are now organized per page using css variables, making it easier to implement a more customizable dark theme. To comply with UCLA Policy 863 on Filming and Photography, all UCLA images have been removed and replaced with original photographs. Images were also optimized using TinyPNG for reduced file sizes.
